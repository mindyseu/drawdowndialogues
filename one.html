            <p>Climate change is an issue of irrefutable importance, and one we have to contend with as a group.In this interview, we look into what has to be done to reach Drawdown and reverse the effects of centuries’ worth of negligence. Without significant and sustained structural change, any efforts at mitigating climate change will be fruitless. Yet, this grand effort can’t be done without making sure that emotion is included in the conversation. Doing just this is Jamie Beck Alexander, founding Director of Drawdown Labs and solutions-based climate advocate set on helping us get there.</p>

            <div class="question">
                <span class="bold  ">Interviewer:</span> You've had an extensive career in environmentalism in both local and foreign humanitarian efforts, as well strategy and leadership in the business world. Was there a definitive moment in your life that fostered this care for the natural world, or was it more of a gradual progression of learning and activism?
            </div>
            <p> I come from a very conservative family in coal country. My family and grandparents all worked in coal and steel, very much Trump loving conservatives in Pennsylvania. It wasn't until college that I began learning about issues related to the environment and kind of changed my worldview of it. I shifted towards open-mindedness and decided that I wanted to work in foreign aid, looking at how I could use my privilege to support developing countries. I started working at the US Agency for International Development on global health issues, including malaria, and HIV, AIDS and infectious diseases. And that work took me to Bangladesh, where I would say was my pivotal moment.</p>

                <p>I thought the most noble and important thing I could do with my life was to get health programs in place in developing countries or involve myself in humanitarian work. It wasn't until I lived in Bangladesh that I realized no matter how much work we did with local communities to improve health outcomes, the place is still sinking. Nothing about any work there is sustainable unless we addressed climate change. That was in 2008 and was the most profound set of experiences of my life, understanding the gravity of the climate crisis and learning that the local people already have their own solutions. That totally changed my mindset, that every issue I worked on needed to have a strong climate component.

            <div class="question">
               You had previously done work towards decarbonizing the transportation sector in San Francisco. Of the work you were involved in, could you speak more about any outcomes that you thought were particularly significant?
            </div>
            <p>In my last role I was getting very frustrated with the pace of change and individual companies setting one-off emissions reduction targets. At the time I was working really closely with Uber trying to get them to set ambitious emissions reduction targets.I was also working with their investors and employees to pressure the CEO into more deliberately confronting their effect on the climate. And finally, Uber said to me, “We can set all the targets we want, but without actually changing the whole infrastructure, we can’t achieve those targets.” For Uber to electrify their entire fleet of cars by 2040, that requires a lot of change beyond Uber. That requires EV charging stations to be in place throughout cities, it requires people across socio-economic backgrounds to have access to electric vehicles that are affordable. Policies need to be in place to enable that change. It became very clear that this wasn't just one company's problem; it was an opportunity for the entire transportation sector to come together. We ended up bringing in IDEO to help us facilitate that work, and we pulled together as many of the actors in that space as we could. I'd say the greatest outcomes so far have been Uber setting that target and also making those connections that weren't previously there. The city actually had lawsuits against Uber and Lyft, but we brought them together and they realized we have the same goals and we need one another to achieve them.</p>

            <div class="question">
                You transitioned from the transportation sector to Project Drawdown as the director of Drawdown Labs in March. What drew you to work with them?

            </div>
            <p>The work I was doing at Ceres, where I led the transportation related work, really focused on pressuring companies and having campaigns to get them to incrementally progress. I was really frustrated with that. I felt I was constantly trying to push the organization in a direction that was uncomfortable for them. Project Drawdown takes more of a solutions-oriented approach. Thinking about things just in terms of doing ‘less bad’ doesn't give us a vision for what we're trying to move toward. It’s totally insufficient. We need to actually articulate a vision for what we're trying to be, and build towards that. In doing that we will achieve drawdown and get our emissions to below zero. It brings more people into the conversation beyond just the technical experts, so that felt like a better fit for the way I see the problem and where we need to go.
