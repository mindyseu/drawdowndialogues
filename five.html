            <p>Miranda Gorman speaks about the ideas of sustainability, implementation and consumption and explore ways in which these topics affect us all and how we can redefine/challenge how we are related to them. Miranda Gorman’s research focuses on the sustainability of material resources and she completed her Ph.D. in 2019 in the Environmental Engineering, Sustainability and Science Group at Carnegie Mellon University.</p>

            <div class="question">
                <span class="bold  ">Interviewer:</span> What inspired you to begin your research regarding sustainability of material resources?
            </div>
            <p> The field that that kind of led me into was life cycle assessments, where you can think about a system or program or a good throughout its entire lifecycle, and try to analyze all of the environmental impacts through each lifecycle phase, from extraction through processing. Material resources was another thing that was interesting to me, because I think it's an area that gets overlooked a lot. When people are thinking about sustainability, they aren't thinking about the fact that literally everything that we own, is made out of something and most of the time, that stuff is not renewable. </p>

                "Making choices if you can to bike somewhere or walk somewhere or take public transportation is, I think, the easiest way to make more sustainable choices."
            </div>

            <div class="question ">
                 Pollution and greenhouse gas emissions are falling across continents, as countries try to contain the spread of the new coronavirus. Do you believe this is just a fleeting change? Or could it lead to longer lasting falls in emissions?
            </div>
            <p>I think that there is a possibility. There's something that we talk about a lot in environmental engineering, which is called the rebound effect: when you see an improvement in something, the immediate reaction to that is actually a negative effect. I would not be that shocked if there were some sort of a rebound effect after this, where everyone is taking a million flights and going on vacation. Because honestly, I would kill for a vacation. </p>
            <p>I do think that there is an opportunity here to learn, and I think that people are realizing now what is necessary and what isn't necessary in terms of the choices that they make. And I think that there is an opportunity for a long term, net reduction in individuals’ transportation and greenhouse gas footprints. I do think that there's an opportunity that isn't necessarily being capitalized on though, which is the fact that the majority of greenhouse gas emissions are not from people's individual choices. It's not from people commuting to work and stuff like that. Even though we see reductions there, and those even maybe after, you know, after a short term rebound effect, if those do fall to a slightly lower level, I think that there's an opportunity here for companies to try and take advantage of that and amplify it and for industry to start thinking about how they can promote changes within themselves and not just count on individuals making choices. Making sustainable choices can be a smart business decision. </p>

            <div class="question">
                We have a governmental system that strongly opposes the Green New Deal and are defensive of processes and industries such as fracking. How did you and do you continue to assert your research and rally for change?

            </div>
            <p>There's obviously a major component, which are the everyday changes that we can make in our own personal lives and in your circle. By talking to your friends about choices that they make, I'm talking to people about voting, things like that.The main thing that Drawdown does is beyond being a research organization—we’re a communications organization. A really big goal of the production of all of our scientific and analytical studies is communicating those results to the public and making it clear to individuals and to corporations, what the potential is for reversing climate change and what the benefits are. </p>

            <p>One of the things that we do is investigate all the solutions that we model. We also identify the finances of adopting that solution. Maybe for this process, it's going to be a little bit more expensive up front, the first costs are going to increase, but over the course of the lifetime of this system, there's actually going to be net savings. That is actually typically what we see for sustainable choices. There's energy savings associated with reduced energy costs. There's a lot of ways in which making sustainable choices is actually like a fiscally conservative decision. I think that advocating for that and framing things from that point of view, is sort of one of the real advantages of the way that drawdown does research and communicates our results. So saying, what is the equivalent cost associated with pollution, not only the total cost to clean up, but trying to equivocate environmental impacts to a financial cost. You know it's a capitalist society, and money is something that people understand.
